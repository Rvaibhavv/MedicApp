Here's a sample `README.md` for your project, split into two parts: the Medical App (React Native) and the Backend (Django with PostgreSQL).

---

# Medical App and Backend

## Overview
This project is a **Medical Application** built with **React Native** for the frontend and **Django** for the backend. The backend is connected to a **PostgreSQL** database for storing medical data, including user registration details and doctor information. The project is designed for efficient user interaction and scalable data management.

## Frontend (Medical App)

This part of the project is built using **React Native** and includes the medical app's user interface and functionality.

### Technologies
- React Native CLI
- NativeWind (for Tailwind CSS in React Native)
- React Navigation
- PostgreSQL (via Django backend)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the `medical-app` directory.
    ```bash
    cd medical-app
    ```
3. Install dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Install necessary packages like `react-navigation`, `react-native-google-fonts`, and others.
    ```bash
    npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack react-native-google-fonts
    ```
5. Connect to your backend (Django) server by configuring the API URL in your `API.js` or similar file.
    - For emulator: Use `10.0.2.2`
    - For physical device: Use the machine's local IP.

### Running the App
To run the app on an Android device or emulator:
```bash
npm start
```
Make sure your device is connected or the emulator is running.

## Backend (Django)

The backend of the project is built using **Django** with **Django REST Framework**. It handles API requests and interacts with the **PostgreSQL** database.

### Technologies
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL

### Setup
1. Clone the repository if you haven't already.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4. Install dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Set up your PostgreSQL database.
    - Update your `settings.py` with your PostgreSQL credentials:
      ```python
      DATABASES = {
          'default': {
              'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
              'NAME': '<database_name>',
              'USER': '<username>',
              'PASSWORD': '<password>',
              'HOST': 'localhost',
              'PORT': '5432',
          }
      }
      ```

6. Apply migrations.
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

### Running the Server
Start the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### API Endpoints
- **/medapp/doctors/** - Fetches list of doctors.
- **/medapp/register/** - Registers a new user.
- **/medapp/login/** - Authenticates user login.

---

## Database (PostgreSQL)

The project uses PostgreSQL as the database for storing user and medical data.

### Database Configuration
- Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
- Create a database for the project:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE medical_db;
    ```
- Make sure the database is linked correctly in the Django `settings.py`.
